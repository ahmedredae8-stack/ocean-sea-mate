- Keep all seven in-game dock destinations as windows over the sea, retaining their existing icon artwork; this preserves the game's navigation context.
- Render the captain portrait as a tall square beside two compact resource/identity rows; this keeps the captain visible at the stage's fixed aspect ratio.
- Keep unavailable inventory, commerce, battle, and ranking records as honest empty or disabled states until authoritative gameplay records exist; fabricated results would mislead players.

- Resolve live boat poses by catalog product ID, not lane ID, with custom pose then idle then bundled fallback; studio and sea must share keys.
- Broadcast artwork updates and renew signed image URLs; mounted sea and store views must not retain stale art.
- Use Nitro’s Vercel preset for external deployment; the Lovable harness retains its own managed target.
- Scope social windows to the fixed stage and shared HUD tokens; viewport-sized children must not overflow embedded windows.
- Render the store ship tab through TradingFloor, shared with the map market, so catalog and ownership cannot diverge.
- Keep fishing duration/catch caps in fishingTrip and cancel per-boat timers on recall so late transitions cannot restart a returned trip.
- Keep simulated community conversations separate from real messages and player records so demo activity never impersonates real users.
- Render every in-game window, including the store, through the shared cabin shell (bottom-docked, one fixed size); mixed shells caused inconsistent window sizes.
